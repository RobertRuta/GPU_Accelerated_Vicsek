    Noise generation looks highly suspicious. At low noise the shaking of the particles seems too aggressive, although
    it is possible this is simply a manifestation of the combination of low speed and frequent perturbation update.

    Upon deeper consideration it seems that the perturbation function is being handled incorrectly, because
    the perturbations happen as often as the frames are being computed. This means that in 1 second a particle 
    will travel a fixed distance due to its constant speed, but will have its direction changed a number of times 
    that is dependent on the simulation's frame rate. The particles should change their direction a fixed 
    number of times each second, and should be defined by a variable called something like "perturbation_frequency".

    Plotting the rodriguez rotation process in numpy, I have shown that using randomly generated direction vectors 
    along with a second batch of same shape of randomly generated vectors, crossing the two leads to vectors clumping 
    on a diagonally oriented ring. There is something wrong with my fundemental assumptions here.

    False alarm. The former phenomenon was caused by generating random numbers in the range of 0, 1 
    instead of -1 to 1.
