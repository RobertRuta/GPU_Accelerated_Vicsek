    The sorted seems to sort some values incorrectly (very rarely). The singular case 
    I have spotted features a particle that is particularly close to the cell boundary,
    and it is sorted as if the particle is on the other side of the boundary. Perhaps this 
    hints at some sort of rounding error?
    This could also, however be a result of the sorter and the particle update running 
    at the same time. I'm still not fully clear on how different dispatches are run...
    whether concurrently or sequentially.
