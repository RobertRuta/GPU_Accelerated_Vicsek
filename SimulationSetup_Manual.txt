##############     TLDR     ##############
- Install unity hub
- Use Unity Hub to open the cloned repository
- Press play to run the simulation and mess around with the simulation parameters in the "Inspector" panel after selecting the "Simulation"
  object in the "Hierarchy" panel
- Use W, A, S, D and Q, E to move the camera. Hold shift to go faster. Right-Mouse Button to look around.
  Scroll-wheel also works for zooming.
- Source files can be found in "GPU_Accelerated_Vicsek/Assets/"



############## Instructions ##############


##### Requirements #####

- git
- unity hub


##### Set up #####

- Download Unity Hub from the following page: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
- Install Unity Hub
- Clone the following git repository: https://github.com/RobertRuta/GPU_Accelerated_Vicsek (git clone git@github.com:RobertRuta/GPU_Accelerated_Vicsek.git)
- In Unity Hub navigate to the Projects tab and click "Open", a file explorer window should pop up ("Select a project to open...").
- Navigate using the file explorer window to the folder that contains the cloned repository.
- Select the repository (should be named "GPU_Accelerated_Vicsek") and click open.
- You may be prompted to download and install a unity editor before opening the project, follow the insturction on screen to do this
  but be careful with what options you select, because by default unity wants to install Visual Studio with the editor (maybe you don't want this).
  No additional modules need to be installed with the editor in order to run the project.
- After a few minutes of loading (takes longer on first launch) the Unity editor window should pop up


##### Playing the simulation #####

- In the "Hierarchy" panel, select the "Simulation" object
- In the "Inspector" window you should see a Transform component, and a Particle Controller component.
- The "Transform" component can be ignored it does not influence the simulation in any way
- The "Particle Controller" component is where all the parameters can be found. All can be modified at runtime, but you should only modify NumParticles, Box,
  Neighbour Radius, Noise, and Speed. 
- To play the simulation press the triangle play button (should be at the top-middle of the editor window)
- To end the simulation press the triangle play button whilst the simulation is running


##### Finding the source files #####

- Find the "Project" panel
- In the "Assets" directory you will find:
	C# code: "GPU_Accelerated_Vicsek/Assets/scripts"
	HLSL and ShaderLab code: "GPU_Accelerated_Vicsek/Assets/shaders"
	Sampled noise texture: "GPU_Accelerated_Vicsek/Assets/textures"
- Double click on source code assets in order to open them in your default IDE
